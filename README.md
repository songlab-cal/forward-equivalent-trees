# forward-equivalent-trees
Efficiently simulating multi-type birth-death processes via forward-equivalent parameter mapping

The simulations and plots are produced by the jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory. These should be run in the following order:

* Run all cells in `efficiency.ipynb` in order to run all simulations. It will read output to a `data` sub-directory provided the `save_to_file` global varialbe and the `"save_tree"` key in the respective `sim_spec` are set to `True`.
* After this, any of the three remaining notebooks can be run. These will create output images in a `fig` sub-directory.
	* `distribution_tests.ipynb`: This creates histograms comparing several tree statistics between the full and forward-equivalent simulations.
	* `timing_plots.ipynb`: This creates plots comparing the run-time of the ful and forward-equivalent simulations across three model specifications. By changing the `sim_idx` variable and then running all cells, one can create plots for each of the different model specificaitons.
	* `draw_tree.ipynb`: This draws a tree generated by the huge population simulation specification.
